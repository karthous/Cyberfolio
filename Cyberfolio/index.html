                    <article>
                        In this stage, I explored the government's datasets by searching the datasets with some keywords, and I got the idea of "School Information". 
                        The posters of my idea are shown below.
                    </article>

                        In addition, I practised my design skills with exercises. 
                        An example of my works is shown below.

                    <article>
                        I was responsible for managing the <a href="https://github.com/karthous/DECO7180">GitHub repository of our group</a>, and I arranged for our group meetings.
                        We had online meetings at least twice a week (with Discord), and used Google Drive to store the documents for our meeting.

                    <article>
                        In part A, I finished the "Plan for completion" section of our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sDE1MjnoKk-YZQx_76Hw0_dFyFSlDodi/view?usp=sharing">team concept</a>.
                        Additionally, I created our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UumHUp2ZRXcAKKAYXLp0TbBqIkqZGlR-/view?usp=sharing">work plan</a> individually.

                    <h3>Part B</h3>
                    <article>
                        In part B, I finished the maps on our <a href="https://deco7180teams-pfc02t06.uqcloud.net/reserves.html">reserves page</a> and <a href="https://deco7180teams-pfc02t06.uqcloud.net/campingSites.html">campsites page</a> individually with <a href="https://data.gov.au/">the government's API</a>, <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">leaflet.js</a>, and <a href="https://terraformer-js.github.io/">terraformer.js</a>.
                        Leaflet is used to show the geojson data on the map. 
                        As some of the data from the government's datasets are in format of well-know text instead of geojson, Terraformer is used to convert well-known text data to genjson data. 
                        With the map, we can obtain the information about the name, location, and website of a destination if the information is provided by the government's dataset.
                        If the information is not provided, it will show that the information is unknown.
                        Besides, I did the presentation with one of my teammates.

                        In part C, I finished the maps on our <a href="https://deco7180teams-pfc02t06.uqcloud.net/skateparks.html">skateparks page</a> and <a href="https://deco7180teams-pfc02t06.uqcloud.net/gardens.html">gardens page</a> individually with the same technology used in part B.
                        I managed to upload all our files (with FileZilla) to uqcloud by remotely accessing UQ lab's computer (with mRemoteNG), and got all the pages work before the trade show.
                        In the trade show, I was responsible for introducing our interactive maps to our audience in the trade show as one of the presenters.

                        I participated in all the workshops as well as all the contacts and completed all the four journals. 
                        The journals helped me to reflect on my study.

                    <article>
                        In this stage, I created this page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                        It was named as Cyberfolio, because this page applied the cyberpunk style and it was used for my portfolio. 
                        To style this page, I researched the knowledge about cyberpunk and carefully selected the colors and fonts.
                        Three external free fonts ("Cyberpunk-Regular.ttf", "Cybrpnuk2.ttf", and "ScriptsoftRegular.ttf") were imported.
                        The web accessibility of this page had been checked by WAVE (powered by WebAIM).
                        If more time is given, I would improve the design and add more interactive elements to this page.

                <article>
                    The original expectation I wrote in my first journal was met. 
                    I learned Adobe Illustrator, JSON, PHP, and project management from this course, while the original expectation only includes learning Adobe Illustrator and JSON. 
                    As I progressed in the course, I found that this course is more than a course teaching team collaboration and how to use API.
                    It helps me in many aspects.
                    For example, with what I learned from this course, I made great contribution to our team in another course: Design Computing Studio 3 - Build (DECO7381). 
                    Examples of the works benefited from this course are listed in the section "Other Work".
                    I was happy to see the layout of the Blackboard assessment page was modified after we sent the feedback about it.
                    I think the course would be increasingly better if it keeps improving by the feedback from students.
